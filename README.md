# Employee Attrition Analysis and Insights (in progress)

## Project Overview 

In this project we perform intricate examination of employee datasets, through nuanced SQL querying and sophisticated Python-driven analytics to decipher underlying patterns and emergent insights.Our main objectives are the following:

- Extract specific subsets of data using SQL.
- Implement Python for data computations.
- Engage libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly for thorough data scrutiny and visual presentations.

## Data Sources 

Our main data source is the emp_attrition.csv that was provided by the [Machine Learning and AI Bootcamp](https://academy.workearly.services/course/machine-learning-and-ai-bootcamp)
